Description: fped - Footprint editor
  fped is an editor that allows the interactive creation of footprints of
  electronic components. Footprint definitions are stored in a text format
  that resembles a programming language.

  The language is constrained such that anything that can be expressed in
  the textual definition also has a straightforward equivalent operation
  that can be performed through the GUI.

  This README describes only the footprint definition language. A
  description of the GUI can be found here:
