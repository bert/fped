Description: Footprint editor
 fped is an editor that allows the interactive creation of footprints of
 electronic components. Footprint definitions are stored in a text format
 that resembles a programming language.
 .
 The language is constrained such that anything that can be expressed in
 the textual definition also has a straightforward equivalent operation
 that can be performed through the GUI.
 .
 A description of the GUI can be found here:
