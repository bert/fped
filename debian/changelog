fped (0.1+201210-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New snapshot, taken from commit 5b21495
  * Switched to new project host: http://projects.qi-hardware.com/p/fped
  * debian/rules:
    - include debian buildflags
    - rewrite as a minimal rules file using dh
    - add a get-orig-source target
  * Fix "FTBFS: tsort: cycle: ./Common: line 37:  2851 Aborted"
    This was a "false error" - the regression test is supposed to cause
    fped to abort, which it did, but the shell didn't print "Aborted" on
    that(Debian on Renesas SH(sh4) CPU) platform (Closes: #606536).
