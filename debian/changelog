fped (0.0+r5997-1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Fix "FTBFS: tsort: cycle: ./Common: line 37:  2851 Aborted"
    This was a "false error" - the regression test is supposed to cause
    fped to abort, which it did, but the shell didn't print "Aborted" on
    that(Debian on Renesas SH(sh4) CPU) platform (Closes: #606536).
  * update the homepage to help webpage, not svn source code page.
